Company Description by Aries Engineering Co., Inc
Aries Engineering/HyperCyl was incorporated in 1994. We are a family-owned company in Dundee, MI. Aries Engineering manufactures hydra-pneumatic cylinders, electro-mechanical actuators, and presses and assembly cells incorporating our actuators.

HyperCyl cylinders deliver up to 200 tons of force without the use of hydraulic cylinders and power units.

HyperCyl hydra-pneumatic cylinders are completely self-contained, and can deliver up to 200 tons force, using shop air. Total strokes can be as high as 24 inches. Power strokes can be as high as 6 inches. There are no hydraulic power units with these, and no external reservoir, which allows HyperCyl to be mounted in any attitude. The HyperCyl hydra-pneumatic cylinders are controlled by two 4-way pneumatic valves. We can enhance our hydra-pneumatic cylinders with an LVDT and load cell (IntelliCyl) for force/distance monitoring and signature analysis with the HyperView-Press.

The HyperCyl-ema (electro mechanical actuator) can deliver up to 25 More... tons. These are servo controlled ball screw or roller screw actuators.

 Applications where HyperCyl shines are:

 - Part insertion (we are bushing insertion and bearing insertion experts). 

 - Punching and Piercing

 - Riveting and Staking

 - Clinching

 - Crimping

 - Forming

 - Flaring

 HyperCyl is advantageous over hydraulics in these areas:

 - Acquisition cost savings

 - Space savings (real estate)

 - Nearly no heat and noise

 - Speed of actuation

 HyperCyl is advantageous over multi-stage pneumatic cylinders because HyperCyl achieves the force needed while using significantly less air, and having a significantly smaller footprint.

 HyperCyl cylinders have no internal springs which can break. No springs allow for no stored energy one-stop.

 Aries Engineering welcomes special applications. We have made more specials than standard cylinders, and at very fair prices.

 HyperCyl hydra-pneumatic cylinders have a limited lifetime warranty.

Company Description by Robeck Fluid Power Co.
Robeck Fluid Power Co. was founded in Solon, Ohio (a Cleveland suburb), by Peter W. Becker in May 1983. In 1985, Robeck began its relationship with the Robert Bosch Corporation. During the next few years, Robeck devoted the majority of its resources to developing a Bosch presence in both the steel and plastic industries. Because of these efforts, Robeck became one of Bosch's largest distributors. In 2001, Bosch and Rexroth formed Bosch Rexroth AG. With this change, Robeck ended its long relationship with Bosch and formed a new relationship with Eaton Corporation as a fully authorized distributor for Eaton, Char-Lynn, Hydro-Line, and Vickers.

In December 1995, Robeck moved to a new 35,000-square-foot facility located in Aurora, Ohio. With 45 employees and the addition of world-class suppliers and disciplines, Robeck continues to provide its customers with quality products and service on a repeat basis.","['Cylinders: Hydraulic', 'Cylinders', 'Cylinders: Eaton\x99', 'Cylinders: NFPA Standard', 'Cylinders: Pneumatic', 'Cylinders: Rodless']","['Conveyors', 'Power Units', 'Hydraulic Equipment', 'Automation Systems', 'Cylinders', 'Electronic Components', 'Pneumatic Systems', 'Pumps', 'Accumulators', 'Actuators', 'Adapters', 'Air Filtration Equipment & Supplies', 'Amplifiers', 'Balancers', 'Balls', 'Bases', 'Batteries', 'Bearings', 'Bolts', 'Brackets', 'Breathers', 'Bushings', 'Buttons', 'Cameras']",https://www.thomasnet.com/products-services.html?cov=NA&heading=21650809&what=hydraulic+cylinders&cid=42468&search_position=12&product_family=151613,"['Eaton', 'Farval', 'HYDAC', 'Hydro-Line', 'Vickers']",,Distributor,"Manufacturer, Custom Manufacturer, Service Company","['Peter Becker, President', 'Philipp Becker, Vice-President', 'Ida Becker, Treas.', 'Mike Cohn, Customer Services Mgr.', 'Bob Long, Engineering Mgr.']",,,$10 - 24.9 Mil,1983,50-99,https://www.thomasnet.com/profile/00042468/robeck-fluid-power-co.html?cid=42468&cov=NA&heading=21650809&searchpos=12&what=hydraulic+cylinders,hydraulic cylinders

Company Description by Kadet Products, Inc.
When parts and equipment become clogged with dirt or finally just break down, most manufacturers are forced to choose between replacing the component or trying to clean and repair it in-house. Its a painful trade-off: get better performance at a higher price or sacrifice productivity to save money. 

Kadet Products gives you the best of both worlds: better-than-new parts at a fraction of the cost of new. Every day Kadet receives dirty, greasy, corroded parts and broken down components. We disassemble them, clean them, strip them, and remanufacture them, then rush them back to their owners in our own fleet of custom designed trucks. In as little as 48 hours, life is back to normal on our clients production floor. 

Why spend more than you need to? Why tie up valuable resources and limited space on work that generates no revenue? Discover why Kadet is the better choice. Let us show you the difference between clean and Kadet clean.",['Cylinders: Hydraulic'],"['Automotive Parts', 'Bending Services', 'Blasting and Peening Services', 'Boring Services', 'Broaching Services', 'Cleaning Services', 'Coating Services', 'Coatings', 'COVID-19 Response', 'Cutting Services', 'Cylinders', 'Deburring / Deflashing Services', 'Disassembly Services', 'Drilling Services', 'Engine Parts', 'Fabrication Services', 'Finishing Services', 'Flushing Services', 'Forming Services', 'Grinding Services', 'Inspection Services', 'Job Shop Services', 'Knurling Services', 'Machine Tools', 'Machining', 'Maintenance and Repair Services', 'Manufacturing Services', 'Medical Components']",https://www.thomasnet.com/products-services.html?cov=NA&heading=21650809&what=hydraulic+cylinders&cid=956168&search_position=124&product_family=164016,,,Service Company,"Custom Manufacturer, Finishing Service Company, Remanufacturer",['Not Available'],,,Under $1 Mil,1986,10-49,https://www.thomasnet.com/profile/00956168/kadet-products-inc.html?cid=956168&cov=NA&heading=21650809&searchpos=124&what=hydraulic+cylinders,hydraulic cylinders

Company Description by B & H Machine, Inc.
In our 70,000 square foot facility, B&H has the capability to manufacture a wide range of cylinders as well as general machine work. In addition to our standard catalog cylinders, we excel in special design cylinders for any application. Large bore and long stroke cylinders are our specialty.

B&H Machine, Inc. was founded in 1951. Tooling and fixture design was performed for the Army, Navy and Air Force, in addition to intricate and production machining for automotive, mining and steel mill industries.

After working many years with various hydraulic cylinder manufacturers, B&H began marketing its own line of cylinders in 1967. Since that time, efforts have been concentrated primarily to the design and building of heavy-duty air and hydraulic cylinders.

On November 3, 1983 More... the Pathon Cylinder line was purchased from the Parker Hannifin Corp., thus broadening the company's product base and providing additional service to our customers.

 The tremendous growth of B&H was by no accident. From the beginning, management determined to make God the Senior Partner. Our products must meet the demands of the industry. If sometimes we fail on our end because we are human, we find it imperative to do our utmost to make it right.
