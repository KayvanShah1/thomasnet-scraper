Company Description by Aries Engineering Co., Inc
Aries Engineering/HyperCyl was incorporated in 1994. We are a family-owned company in Dundee, MI. Aries Engineering manufactures hydra-pneumatic cylinders, electro-mechanical actuators, and presses and assembly cells incorporating our actuators.

HyperCyl cylinders deliver up to 200 tons of force without the use of hydraulic cylinders and power units.

HyperCyl hydra-pneumatic cylinders are completely self-contained, and can deliver up to 200 tons force, using shop air. Total strokes can be as high as 24 inches. Power strokes can be as high as 6 inches. There are no hydraulic power units with these, and no external reservoir, which allows HyperCyl to be mounted in any attitude. The HyperCyl hydra-pneumatic cylinders are controlled by two 4-way pneumatic valves. We can enhance our hydra-pneumatic cylinders with an LVDT and load cell (IntelliCyl) for force/distance monitoring and signature analysis with the HyperView-Press.

The HyperCyl-ema (electro mechanical actuator) can deliver up to 25 More... tons. These are servo controlled ball screw or roller screw actuators.

 Applications where HyperCyl shines are:

 - Part insertion (we are bushing insertion and bearing insertion experts). 

 - Punching and Piercing

 - Riveting and Staking

 - Clinching

 - Crimping

 - Forming

 - Flaring

 HyperCyl is advantageous over hydraulics in these areas:

 - Acquisition cost savings

 - Space savings (real estate)

 - Nearly no heat and noise

 - Speed of actuation

 HyperCyl is advantageous over multi-stage pneumatic cylinders because HyperCyl achieves the force needed while using significantly less air, and having a significantly smaller footprint.

 HyperCyl cylinders have no internal springs which can break. No springs allow for no stored energy one-stop.

 Aries Engineering welcomes special applications. We have made more specials than standard cylinders, and at very fair prices.

 HyperCyl hydra-pneumatic cylinders have a limited lifetime warranty.

Company Description by Robeck Fluid Power Co.
Robeck Fluid Power Co. was founded in Solon, Ohio (a Cleveland suburb), by Peter W. Becker in May 1983. In 1985, Robeck began its relationship with the Robert Bosch Corporation. During the next few years, Robeck devoted the majority of its resources to developing a Bosch presence in both the steel and plastic industries. Because of these efforts, Robeck became one of Bosch's largest distributors. In 2001, Bosch and Rexroth formed Bosch Rexroth AG. With this change, Robeck ended its long relationship with Bosch and formed a new relationship with Eaton Corporation as a fully authorized distributor for Eaton, Char-Lynn, Hydro-Line, and Vickers.

In December 1995, Robeck moved to a new 35,000-square-foot facility located in Aurora, Ohio. With 45 employees and the addition of world-class suppliers and disciplines, Robeck continues to provide its customers with quality products and service on a repeat basis.","['Cylinders: Hydraulic', 'Cylinders', 'Cylinders: Eaton\x99', 'Cylinders: NFPA Standard', 'Cylinders: Pneumatic', 'Cylinders: Rodless']","['Conveyors', 'Power Units', 'Hydraulic Equipment', 'Automation Systems', 'Cylinders', 'Electronic Components', 'Pneumatic Systems', 'Pumps', 'Accumulators', 'Actuators', 'Adapters', 'Air Filtration Equipment & Supplies', 'Amplifiers', 'Balancers', 'Balls', 'Bases', 'Batteries', 'Bearings', 'Bolts', 'Brackets', 'Breathers', 'Bushings', 'Buttons', 'Cameras']",https://www.thomasnet.com/products-services.html?cov=NA&heading=21650809&what=hydraulic+cylinders&cid=42468&search_position=12&product_family=151613,"['Eaton', 'Farval', 'HYDAC', 'Hydro-Line', 'Vickers']",,Distributor,"Manufacturer, Custom Manufacturer, Service Company","['Peter Becker, President', 'Philipp Becker, Vice-President', 'Ida Becker, Treas.', 'Mike Cohn, Customer Services Mgr.', 'Bob Long, Engineering Mgr.']",,,$10 - 24.9 Mil,1983,50-99,https://www.thomasnet.com/profile/00042468/robeck-fluid-power-co.html?cid=42468&cov=NA&heading=21650809&searchpos=12&what=hydraulic+cylinders,hydraulic cylinders

Company Description by Kadet Products, Inc.
When parts and equipment become clogged with dirt or finally just break down, most manufacturers are forced to choose between replacing the component or trying to clean and repair it in-house. Its a painful trade-off: get better performance at a higher price or sacrifice productivity to save money. 

Kadet Products gives you the best of both worlds: better-than-new parts at a fraction of the cost of new. Every day Kadet receives dirty, greasy, corroded parts and broken down components. We disassemble them, clean them, strip them, and remanufacture them, then rush them back to their owners in our own fleet of custom designed trucks. In as little as 48 hours, life is back to normal on our clients production floor. 

Why spend more than you need to? Why tie up valuable resources and limited space on work that generates no revenue? Discover why Kadet is the better choice. Let us show you the difference between clean and Kadet clean.",['Cylinders: Hydraulic'],"['Automotive Parts', 'Bending Services', 'Blasting and Peening Services', 'Boring Services', 'Broaching Services', 'Cleaning Services', 'Coating Services', 'Coatings', 'COVID-19 Response', 'Cutting Services', 'Cylinders', 'Deburring / Deflashing Services', 'Disassembly Services', 'Drilling Services', 'Engine Parts', 'Fabrication Services', 'Finishing Services', 'Flushing Services', 'Forming Services', 'Grinding Services', 'Inspection Services', 'Job Shop Services', 'Knurling Services', 'Machine Tools', 'Machining', 'Maintenance and Repair Services', 'Manufacturing Services', 'Medical Components']",https://www.thomasnet.com/products-services.html?cov=NA&heading=21650809&what=hydraulic+cylinders&cid=956168&search_position=124&product_family=164016,,,Service Company,"Custom Manufacturer, Finishing Service Company, Remanufacturer",['Not Available'],,,Under $1 Mil,1986,10-49,https://www.thomasnet.com/profile/00956168/kadet-products-inc.html?cid=956168&cov=NA&heading=21650809&searchpos=124&what=hydraulic+cylinders,hydraulic cylinders

 Mark Murphy, President

  When I talk to someone about FASTORQ products, the first thing tell them is about the speed and durability of our tools, explains Mark, a U.S. Navy Veteran and Colorado native. Inevitably, the person wants to know who our top competitors are in the trade. Without hesitation, I tell them we really dont have any serious competition  at least if they are looking for tools that perform at faster speeds and are built to actually last in the brutal environments they are designed for. FASTORQ products are stronger, built to endure, and designed to deliver faster, more powerful results than any other tool on the market.

 Harry Maynes, Vice President of Sales

 Harry, a native New Yorker, says Ive always been in the top one to two percent of sales pros in industries I serve. This happens because I know I cant do it alone -- so I want the best and the brightest working with me. Its very simple, when we do our jobs well and right, everyone -- our customer, their customers, and FASTORQ -- makes money. We bring to the table the tools and expertise the customer needs to solve a problem. We know and understand that problems prevent profitability.

 Bill Washington, Director of Business Development

 Bill, a native of Dallas, Texas and U.S. Army veteran explains I have seen, first-hand, how much faster our tools are compared to the competition. I know the quality of how they are manufactured. We can honestly say our tools are better and faster; using them can save hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars of down time - thats a tangible and provable result that not too many other businesses can actually deliver. I see the avenues where growth and innovation are available to us and in truth, the only limitation is our imaginations and willingness to pursue those opportunities. Less",['Cylinders: Hydraulic'],"['Aligners', 'Analyzers', 'Anti-Seize', 'Blocks', 'Bolting Services', 'Bolts', 'Calibration Services', 'Calibrators', 'Chisels', 'Connectors', 'Contractors', 'Controls and Controllers', 'Cylinders', 'Drivers', 'Extractors', 'Fastening Systems', 'Flanges', 'Grease', 'Hydraulic Equipment', 'Indicators', 'Instruments', 'Lifters', 'Lubricants', 'Measuring Equipment', 'Meters', 'Multipliers', 'Nuts', 'Oils']",https://www.thomasnet.com/products-services.html?cov=NA&heading=21650809&what=hydraulic+cylinders&cid=655946&search_position=568&product_family=161277,,,Manufacturer,"Distributor, Custom Manufacturer, Service Company",['Not Available'],"['https://www.twitter.com/FASTORQ1', 'https://www.facebook.com/FASTORQ']",,$1 - 4.9 Mil,1981,10-49,https://www.thomasnet.com/profile/00655946/fastorq.html?cid=655946&cov=NA&heading=21650809&searchpos=568&what=hydraulic+cylinders,hydraulic cylinders
