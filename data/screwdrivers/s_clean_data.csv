Company Description by Ampco Safety Tools
Since 1922, Ampco Safety Tools has set the global standard for non-sparking, non-magnetic, corrosion resistant hand tools. Made of aluminum bronze alloy, our tools are made of the highest quality for the most demanding environments.

We invented the AMPCO aluminum bronze alloy in 1914 and our tool line was introduced in 1922. Today we manufacture over 2,000 tools, nearly all of which are made in the USA. Our tools are made with Factory Mutual approved alloys and have been proven to meet or exceed requirements and recommendations by OSHA, NFPA and MSHA for use in flammable environments.

Some companies confuse brass or copper with bronze due to the similar color of the metals. They are not the same. Brass and pure copper are much softer metals and better suited for non-marring applications, whereas AMPCO bronze is more durable with superior corrosion resistant properties and better suited for heavy duty, industrial environments. Our alloys have been field proven for nearly one hundred years. More... Trusted around the world for superior craftsmanship and durability, we look forward to working with you.

Variables are the enemy of quality products. Our tools help you eliminate variables in torque applications. We started the torque tool industry in 1924 when Walter P. Chrysler developed the flat beam torque wrench and licensed Paul Sturtevant to manufacture and sell the tool. Prolific inventor Frank Livermont incorporated Richmont in 1940. The two companies merged together during the 1960s to create the world's most comprehensive torque tool line. 

Aside from being first in the industry, the company enjoys a long list of firsts in the torque industry:

First deflecting beam torque wrench. First torque screwdriver. First torque tester. First torque calibration tool. First to develop interchangeable heads for torque tools. The first limited slip clutch for torque tools. First to produce an optical torque tester. First torque tool manufacturer to be 9001 certified. The list goes on and on. 

Being the biggest torque tools manufacturer has never been our goal. We are only concerned with producing More... the world's best torque tools. Our customers tell us we produce the most durable, reliable, and easy to use torque tools. 

 Our tools are used around the world, under the seas and up in space. In any tough environment where tool failure is not an option, people turn to Sturtevant Richmont tools.

 When what you make is important or demands precision, pick up a Sturtevant Richmont torque wrench. Your customers will be glad you did.

Service:

We have an acronym we call FAST that has both a true and underlying meaning. Of course the underlying message to our customers is that we try to do things as quickly as possible. Whether thats a quotation, price check, availability question, shipping or information request  we do it now  we know and understand that there are eager customers or potential customers waiting on us and their time is as valuable as ours.

Secondarily, our word FAST has a definitive meaning:

F  To be Flexible in our ability to serve the customer, to be able to effectively wear the different hats that are required in a smaller organization and to have the customers service issues in mind at all More... times.

 A  To be Accurate in everything we do  from specification to delivery. We understand the consequences of mistakes and the domino effect they can have on the practices of our customers and our combined businesses. Mistakes cost money and time. We seek the proper training to insure that we follow the correct procedures and have the product knowledge necessary to be correct. We know that we need to do it right all the time to eliminate the necessity to do it over.

 S  To act with Speed in all that we do. We know the customer waits for our response or our products and we do not need to waste that time  for we understand that time is money. We want to be able to ship today, quote and specify now, fax immediately, confirm orders on receipt  respond NOW. For we know that this will win our customers support and future business and trust.

 T  To act as a Team so that our effort is multiplied to produce a much greater result for our customers. To have the positive attitude that is so common in winners. The understanding that people want to be winners and work with winners  with people who are successful not only in what they do but how they work together. We are a Team who acts as one on behalf of our dedicated customers, whom we would be nothing without.

Company Description by Bolts 'n Nuts Plus
About Bolts 'N Nuts Plus

Bolts 'n Nuts Plus was founded in Houston in 1970. The original name was just Bolts 'n Nuts because the product lines consisted of bolts, nuts, screws, washers and other commonplace as well as unique industrial fasteners.

Although a significant part of our overall business is conducted in Texas, Bolts 'n Nuts Plus also services nationally and internationally. Among our customers are numerous companies in the oil field industry, as well as the construction. In addition, we are also major suppliers to the hospital/health care industry. As one can tell, our reputation as a broad based, one stop, industrial supplier of not only bolts, nuts, screws, washers, commonplace or unique industrial fasteners, but also fittings, tools, and shop supplies product lines is valued highly More... by a broad customer base. 

 We have worked hard to become a long term, quality based supplier that performs consistently at a high level of customer service. We have a highly motivated staff that is determined to make doing business with Bolts 'n Nuts Plus a pleasant experience. Please give us a try the next time you need bolts, nuts, screws, washers, commonplace or unique industrial fasteners, fittings, tools or shop supplies.

Manufacturer of precision torque control and measuring equipment. Products include torque tools including torque analyzers, torque testers, torque sensors, torque calibrators, torque wrenches, electric screwdrivers, torque screwdrivers, torque multipliers, assembly tools, screw counters and balancers. Industries served include aerospace, automotive, electronics, energy, medical, and packaging.
Company Description by Mountz Inc.
Mountz provides torque tool solutions and metric fasteners to a variety of industries like aerospace, automotive, electronics, energy, medical, packaging and more. Controlling torque is essential for companies to ensure their product's quality, safety and reliability. The failure of a three-cent fastener that isn't properly tightened can lead to catastrophic or latent failures. Fasteners that are insufficiently torqued can vibrate loose, and excessive torque can strip threaded fasteners or damage parts. Using a torque tool has become increasingly important for many companies to ensure that proper torque is being applied and maintains gauge requirements associated with the ISO 9001 Quality Standard.

With over 45 years of experience, let the Mountz staff share their in-depth knowledge of torque solutions with you. Contact us and learn more about how we are consistently developing and producing as well as marketing and servicing highly sophisticated, cutting-edge tools and solutions for the More... industry. Mountz, known among members of the industry as the nation's premier torque tool supplier, is an ISO 9001 certified and ISO 17025 accredited company. Mountz offers tools that comply with ISO6789:2003 and are constructed from high quality materials, engineered for superior reliability and safety and backed by an industry leading warranty.

 In the manufacturing and assembly world, tightening, controlling, or measuring torque fasteners is imperative for production efficiency. An inadequately torqued fastener can vibrate or work loose: conversely, if the tension is too high, the fastener can snap or strip its threads. Faced with these problems, manufacturers are realizing that precise torque control can spell the difference between a safe, reliable, and economical product and complete disaster.

 Effective use of a torque tester is a fast and reliable method of calibrating torque tools to their proper settings. A torque tester can also be used for quick tests on the line or in the lab to determine whether torque tools are holding a given setting. Testers also allow quality control inspectors to calibrate torque sensors and verify torque on fasteners. A quality torque tester should have enough memory to record several hundred readings, and it should store calibration data for multiple torque transducers.

 Mr. Metric (a Mountz company) is the leading metric fastener specialist in North America. Well regarded as experts in metric, Mr. Metric is known for hard to find metric items at competitive prices.

 Let us help give you a competitive advantage through consistent, accurate torque output or readings and a rapid return on your investment, with Mountz torque tools that are built to last. We provide tools that serve as part of your company's infrastructure, instead of tools that have to be replaced every few years. Look for the Mountz logo and know you're receiving the best torque tool in the industry!

Company Description by DME Company LLC
D-M-E was founded to help streamline the manufacture of plastic injection molds. In 1942, Ted Quarnstrom began Detroit Mold Engineering (later to become D-M-E Company) to provide mold bases in standard sizes, ready for machining of the cavity. This innovation empowered the skilled moldmaker to practice his craft more efficiently and the concept of the standard mold base was born. 

D-M-E is focused on one thing -- to help make moldmakers, molders and mold designers produce better parts. Every D-M-E product cuts costs, reduces time-to-market or improves the finished molded product (sometimes all three). Today, the D-M-E product line encompasses a wide range of products, including: mold bases  D-M-E standard, custom-machined and MoldBasics series, plus Master Unit Die (MUD) quick change, mold systems and components, mold components  ejector pins and sleeves, leader and core pins, mold action devices, mold cooling, interlocks, lifters and other components, 

Moldmaking equipment and supplies More...  cutting tools, polishing and finishing equipment and repair welders, hot runner systems and components  from turnkey hot halves to individual components, mold control systems  solutions for hot runner temperature and other electronic control applications, and technical services  application engineering, field service and product support.

Company Description by Electronic Fasteners, Inc.
In 1960, six families recognized the demand in rapidly expanding high-tech industries for consistently superior electronic components. Not only that, these industries also expected their suppliers to understand their needs and to provide services and product specialists to help them meet these needs.

That same year, in a small office in South Boston, Electronic Fasteners Inc. (EFI) was formed. The purpose was to merchandise fasteners of all descriptions, specializing in military quality fasteners used by the electronics, aerospace and defense industries.

Company Description by US Micro Screw
US Micro Screw is a US-based company with offices in Seattle, WA and St. Paul, MN. We are custom micro screw specialists and an international distributor of technical solutions for all small diameter threaded applications. US Micro Screw was founded upon the idea that we could offer hard to find micro screws, custom manufactured to our customers' specifications, with low minimum order quantities, at competitive pricing. That is why we don't typically stock screws (except for what is on our clearance page) and our minimum quantities are 1,000 pieces, making us the ideal choice for even small manufacturers.

US Micro Screw partners with factories in Asia and the USA that specialize in micro screw production using the most modern fabrication technologies. All factories are ISO 9001:2008 certified and all our products are RoHS compliant. All materials and finishes are tested regularly so you are guaranteed to receive consistently high-quality products from US Micro Screw.

Our History 

From humble beginnings in 1976 when we introduced a modest product line of specialty automotive replacement bulbs, Bulbtronics began to build its unique reputation as ""the supplier"" of hard to find light bulbs. As word grew from industry to industry and market to market that a viable source for bulbs and lamps existed, customer interest and response was remarkable. In fact, our customer base has been built largely from inquiries from those in search of specialty lighting and new product development. As our clientele More... expanded, so did our industry contacts, product line and technical capability and experience. This wealth of information now serves as the basis for an extensive and unique database that sustains our business. It enables us to identify product, process orders and ship in-stock items in hours. Our e-commerce Web site and EDI capability have streamlined our speed and efficiency even more. Seven fully stocked distribution centers now ship globally a complete product line. We sell bulbs, batteries, recycling containers and specialty products for select markets. At Bulbtronics, the future looks brighter than ever.

We are committed to ensuring that you have the best possible experience each time you interact with us. That includes helping with technical questions, finding the right tool  even if it's not in our catalog  or going that extra mile to ensure your tools are there on time. Every customer experience should be a ""WOW"" moment. If it's not, let us know!

If you are unsatisfied with your order for any reason, return it for a replacement or a refund of the purchase price. That means no restocking fees or paying for shipping on the replacement item. There are only three rules 

  Items must be in new condition

  Items must be returned with all original packaging and accessories

  You let us know you want to return it within 90 days of your purchase date

If you require a replacement item, it will be shipped out the same day if it's in stock. If paying by credit card, the replacement order WILL be charged to your card and a credit issued shortly after the return item arrives back in our facility. More... Return shipping is on us. You will be provided with a pre-paid UPS or USPS domestic label to return the purchase to us. As always, there is an exception  any non-stock or custom order is subject to additional conditions.

Company Description by Ward's Marine Electric
Powered by Experience

Spanning three generations and 60+ years, Wards Marine Electric has been the benchmark for quality service in the marine industry. All of our technicians are ABYC certified, and exemplify the Wards tradition of making safety and customer satisfaction our top priorities. Our combination of experience and expertise means that Wards Marine Electric services are truly unparalleled.

Powered by Vision

Our Founder, Ward Eshleman Sr., saw a future where a yacht owner could depend on receiving top quality service, wherever he was. In 1950, that meant establishing a direct flight to the Bahamas to bring Wards Marine Electric to our customers. Today, his vision is fully realized, as we can send a fully supported mobile crew to any port on the globe. We have performed emergency services from Dubai to St. Maarten, and have performed extensive repairs from Charleston, SC to Honolulu, HI.

Powered by Imagination

Yacht design is a fluid process, and trends can shift like the evening More... breeze. The creativity that goes into every custom panel and electrical system we build stems from a desire to keep Wards Marine Electric in the forefront of our industry. We are constantly striving to provide the most cutting edge services and products. The integration of wireless services and automation control via tablet apps are examples of our ability as industry pioneers. 

 Powered by Innovation

 Innovation is the use of expertise and imagination to create something new. Every department at Wards Marine Electric epitomizes this definition. We have ABYC certified electricians, engineers, technicians, and painters that convert the ordinary into extraordinary every day. From our distributed-logic switchgear systems to our portable boost transformers; innovation is pivotal to our status as a driving force in the world of marine electric.
