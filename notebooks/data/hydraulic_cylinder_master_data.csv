Company Description by Aries Engineering Co., Inc
Aries Engineering/HyperCyl was incorporated in 1994. We are a family-owned company in Dundee, MI. Aries Engineering manufactures hydra-pneumatic cylinders, electro-mechanical actuators, and presses and assembly cells incorporating our actuators.

HyperCyl cylinders deliver up to 200 tons of force without the use of hydraulic cylinders and power units.

HyperCyl hydra-pneumatic cylinders are completely self-contained, and can deliver up to 200 tons force, using shop air. Total strokes can be as high as 24 inches. Power strokes can be as high as 6 inches. There are no hydraulic power units with these, and no external reservoir, which allows HyperCyl to be mounted in any attitude. The HyperCyl hydra-pneumatic cylinders are controlled by two 4-way pneumatic valves. We can enhance our hydra-pneumatic cylinders with an LVDT and load cell (IntelliCyl) for force/distance monitoring and signature analysis with the HyperView-Press.

The HyperCyl-ema (electro mechanical actuator) can deliver up to 25 More... tons. These are servo controlled ball screw or roller screw actuators.

 Applications where HyperCyl shines are:

 - Part insertion (we are bushing insertion and bearing insertion experts). 

 - Punching and Piercing

 - Riveting and Staking

 - Clinching

 - Crimping

 - Forming

 - Flaring

 HyperCyl is advantageous over hydraulics in these areas:

 - Acquisition cost savings

 - Space savings (real estate)

 - Nearly no heat and noise

 - Speed of actuation

 HyperCyl is advantageous over multi-stage pneumatic cylinders because HyperCyl achieves the force needed while using significantly less air, and having a significantly smaller footprint.

 HyperCyl cylinders have no internal springs which can break. No springs allow for no stored energy one-stop.

 Aries Engineering welcomes special applications. We have made more specials than standard cylinders, and at very fair prices.

 HyperCyl hydra-pneumatic cylinders have a limited lifetime warranty.

Company Description by Robeck Fluid Power Co.
Robeck Fluid Power Co. was founded in Solon, Ohio (a Cleveland suburb), by Peter W. Becker in May 1983. In 1985, Robeck began its relationship with the Robert Bosch Corporation. During the next few years, Robeck devoted the majority of its resources to developing a Bosch presence in both the steel and plastic industries. Because of these efforts, Robeck became one of Bosch's largest distributors. In 2001, Bosch and Rexroth formed Bosch Rexroth AG. With this change, Robeck ended its long relationship with Bosch and formed a new relationship with Eaton Corporation as a fully authorized distributor for Eaton, Char-Lynn, Hydro-Line, and Vickers.

In December 1995, Robeck moved to a new 35,000-square-foot facility located in Aurora, Ohio. With 45 employees and the addition of world-class suppliers and disciplines, Robeck continues to provide its customers with quality products and service on a repeat basis.","['Cylinders: Hydraulic', 'Cylinders', 'Cylinders: Eaton\x99', 'Cylinders: NFPA Standard', 'Cylinders: Pneumatic', 'Cylinders: Rodless']","['Conveyors', 'Power Units', 'Hydraulic Equipment', 'Automation Systems', 'Cylinders', 'Electronic Components', 'Pneumatic Systems', 'Pumps', 'Accumulators', 'Actuators', 'Adapters', 'Air Filtration Equipment & Supplies', 'Amplifiers', 'Balancers', 'Balls', 'Bases', 'Batteries', 'Bearings', 'Bolts', 'Brackets', 'Breathers', 'Bushings', 'Buttons', 'Cameras']",https://www.thomasnet.com/products-services.html?cov=NA&heading=21650809&what=hydraulic+cylinders&cid=42468&search_position=12&product_family=151613,"['Eaton', 'Farval', 'HYDAC', 'Hydro-Line', 'Vickers']",,Distributor,"Manufacturer, Custom Manufacturer, Service Company","['Peter Becker, President', 'Philipp Becker, Vice-President', 'Ida Becker, Treas.', 'Mike Cohn, Customer Services Mgr.', 'Bob Long, Engineering Mgr.']",,,$10 - 24.9 Mil,1983,50-99,https://www.thomasnet.com/profile/00042468/robeck-fluid-power-co.html?cid=42468&cov=NA&heading=21650809&searchpos=12&what=hydraulic+cylinders
